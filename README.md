# NFL Franchise Simulator Game (Java)

This project is a text-based NFL franchise simulator game written in Java.
The user picks the team they want to play as.
They are tasked with turning around the franchise and winning a Super Bowl.
All of this is controlled through a menu where the user can view the roster,
the schedule, the team and league history, and advance through the season. 

# Features
- User picks a team & the code generates a roster that will be altered over the years based on user input
- Menu for viewing roster, schedule, league history, and to advance
## - Regular season:
  - 17 simulated games based on team overall and other factors against other teams in the NFL
## - Playoffs:
- Qualify if team won 10 or more games or 9 wins + 1 tie
- If the team meets the requirements to gain a bye week they only have to win 3 games to win the Super Bowl

- The "owner" picks random players to fill in the open positions

# How To Run
- Open in a Java IDE
- Run NFLSIM class

# Why I Made It
To Practice:
- Object-oriented programming
- A big complex project
- Multiple classes interacting with each other and objects
- Error handling 

# What I Used To Make It 
- Apache NetBeans IDE 27
- Java Programming

# Future Changes
- Adapt project to be UI-based
- Make the game more balanced or easy for normal users 
- Bigger roster and more in-depth player attributes
- Player trading system
